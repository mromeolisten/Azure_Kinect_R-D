AK_DepthVFX_openframeworks - This folder includes an edited version of the 'example-shader' project file in the ofxAzure Kinect openframeworks addon. It renders point cloud data. It also uses spout to send that screen texture to a touch designer patch where we add visual processing. 

AK_Depth_VFX.toe - This project uses the 'isfParser.tox' file to compile 'Interactive Shader Format' shader code. We've applied these visual effects over the 'Spout' input. We also included an audio reactive node to stream in an audio file 'assets/audioreactive.wav' to effect visual effects.
