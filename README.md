## Listen - Azure Kinect Exploration

Our company [Listen](www.wearelisten.com) is sharing experiments using the latest Azure Kinect DK. The [Microsoft official site](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/azure-kinect-dk/8pp5vxmd9nhq?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab) describes the features of the device some included in the table of contents. The idea for this R&D phase it to build out several demos to assist with future creative ideation as well as having a better understanding of the possiblities of the Azure Kinect.

### Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services

Overall we found that we can integrate 

Alternatives: 
[Coral](https://coral.withgoogle.com/): Allows for localized (non-cloud based), free usage of Tensorflow based real-time object detection libraries. The device is handheld that can be run offline. 

YOLO (You Only Look Once): is a real-time software package that is open-source and can run on a live video stream. <br/>
